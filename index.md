### Welcome

This tutorial covers how to get started with python. At Human Movement Sciences Department we are transitioning from Matlab to python for both research and education. This tutorial is meant to facilitate this transition and standardize the way we are using python. It also includes some handy tips and tricks in using python and good practices. Overall, it is intended for anyone who has little or no programming experience.
