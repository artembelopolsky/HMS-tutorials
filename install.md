# Installing python with Anaconda

Why Anaconda? There are many ways to get started with python. Anaconda provides a complete environment for scientific computing. It is similar to Matlab in a way that it sets up the workflow in one single install. Like Matlab, Anaconda is a quite bulky program, with many popular tools and packages (such as numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, pandas, matplotlib) are already pre-installed. Unlike Matlab, it is more flexible and can be extended with many open source packages. And, of course, Anaconda is *free*.

Anaconda includes its own *Python distribution*, so that you don't need to install python separately. It also includes its own *package manager*, as well as *environment manager*. Package manager is essential, since it takes care of managing dependencies across different packages. Environment manager makes it easy to create isolated programming environments for each project, with their own list of dependencies, which do not conflict with other projects. The environments can be shared with collaborators, allowing them to replicate and run the project with the right dependencies.

Anaconda is an easy way to install *Jupyter Notebooks*, which is an even easier way to share your analysis pipeline with the scientific community. It will be covered in a separate tutorial.


# Download and install Anaconda 

1. Go to the Anaconda Website and choose a Python 3.x graphical installer (A).
2. Locate your download and double click it.

We would like to ask you to bring your own laptop to the classes, and to make sure that you have installed a recent version of Python (Python 3.7 or higher) before coming to the first session. We strongly advise you to install the Anaconda distribution of Python 3. The installation files can be found at the following address:

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section

On this page, you can find separate instructions for Windows, Mac and Linux. Next to Python itself, the Anaconda distribution also contains Jupyter Notebook, an environment that can be used to document and to execute Python code. We will use Jupyter Notebooks in this course.

See Anaconda's installation instructions for some important points to consider during installation. For example, the installation path must not contain spaces. If you want to use Anaconda Python from the command line, it helps to add Anaconda to your PATH during the installation, even though this is not recommended by the installer.

If you experience difficulties during the installation of this software, do not hesitate to contact the CDS via email. If necessary, you can make an appointment and ask us to help you install the software. On the 6th of March, the course instructors shall be present in the Heinsius room from 9:00h onwards, to address any technical issues, if needed.
