# Installing python with Anaconda

Why Anaconda? There are many ways to get started with python. Anaconda provides a complete environment for scientific computing. It is similar to Matlab in a way that it sets up the workflow in one single install. Like Matlab, Anaconda is a quite bulky program, with many popular tools and packages (such as numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, pandas, matplotlib) are already pre-installed. Unlike Matlab, it is more flexible and can be extended with many open source packages. And, of course, Anaconda is *free*.

Anaconda includes its own *Python distribution*, so that you don't need to install python separately. It also includes its own *package manager*, as well as *environment manager*. Package manager is essential, since it takes care of managing dependencies across different packages. Environment manager makes it easy to create isolated programming environments for each project, with their own list of dependencies, which do not conflict with other projects. The environments can be shared with collaborators, allowing them to replicate and run the project with the right dependencies.

Anaconda is an easy way to install *Jupyter Notebooks*, which is an even easier way to share your analysis pipeline with the scientific community. It will be covered in a separate tutorial.


# Download and install Anaconda 

1. Go to the [Anaconda Website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) and choose a Python 3.x graphical installer.
2. Locate your download and double click it.
3. Pay attention to Anaconda's installation instructions.
    - the installation path must not contain spaces. 
    - choose to add Anaconda to your PATH during the installation, even though this is not recommended by the installer. Then you will be able to use Anaconda from the *Anaconda Prompt* (recommended).
    - you don't need to install *VSCode* editor, since we will use *Spyder*.
