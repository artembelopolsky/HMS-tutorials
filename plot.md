# Plotting with Matplotlib
The best way to learn python (or any other programming language for that matter) is to apply it. Here we will explore plotting with *Matplotlib* library.

## What is Matplotlib?
Matplotlib is a low-level library in python used for visualizing data.

## Installing Matplotlib package
First, let's ```import``` *Matplotlib* package. Most of the time, you won't need the whole package, but just a subcomponent for plotting called pyplot. Let's import just that.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

>{: .warning}
If matplotlib was not installed in your environment, you will get an error. To install matplotlib, you can open another version of Anaconda prompt, activate the "default" environment and then install the package: ```conda install matplotlib```

## Try plotting tutorial online
There are many matplotlib tutorials online which allow you to try matplotlib in the browser. You can of course also copy the code to your computer and try it out. 

Here is a link to such an online tutorial to get you started with basic plots:
